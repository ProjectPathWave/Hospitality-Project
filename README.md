A comprehensive Power BI dashboard built to analyse and visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) in the hospitality industry, including occupancy, revenue, booking trends, and forecast insights.
Also covered in this project is the parameter dashboard where I am using the parameters and dax formulae to colour code each parameter. for example, the revenue dashboard is displayed in blue, Successful Bookings Dashboard in green and so on and so forth.
